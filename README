cloudGrab by: Galen

This is a soundcloud ripper and spider implemented in python. It can download a single song url, or an entire artists collection.  Other options will be implemented soon.

The script will attempt to detect if the artist allows downloads and if so, attempts to use that file as it typically has a higher bitrate than the standard song file.  It can detect if there are embedded playlists within a collection and will automatically download the songs within that list.

./cloudGrab.py -h
